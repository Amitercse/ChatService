# ChatService
* Python REST service that accepts user query and provide response.
* Application is developed using RAG model to provide context and handles user query based on that context rather than based on generic pretrained data
* Before running application in local ensure embeddings are created in vector store, for first time execution or to update embeddings run data_ingestion.py separately and then start main application
